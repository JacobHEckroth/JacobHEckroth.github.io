        <p>The most trouble that I had with this assignment was remembering syntax. I had to relook up how to add an image, how to link to something, and how to make a horizontal line. I solved these issues by simply looking up the sintax
        to figure out what the correct form of action was. I didn't learn that much from this assignment, because I had already learned most of the knowledge from the reading to prepare for this assignment. Resources that 
        were useful were simply google, specifically w3schools was extremely helpful for me. Overall I felt that I did quite well on this assignment, although the design is a bit lacking. We'll figure that out once we add
        CSS I suppose.</p>
